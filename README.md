# USACO

Includes USACO training practice problems and competitive problems solved in python.

## Installation

No dependencies required, just python!

## How to use

Each problem is stored in its own directory. In each directory, there is a script that uses the data in a `.in` file in its subsequent `data` directory and produces its output in a `.out` file in the same subsequent directory.
